Hereâ€™s a more natural description for GitHub, as if written by a developer:  

---  

This is a simple Python game where the player needs to reconstruct shuffled sentences in the correct order. The sentences are randomly retrieved from Ukrainian Wikipedia, making each round different.  

The game includes multiple difficulty levels that affect the time limit for each round. Players earn points for correct answers, and their total score is displayed at the end. A basic leaderboard system saves high scores for tracking progress.  

The game also provides feedback on the player's performance, showing accuracy and average response time. Incorrect answers display the correct sentence for learning purposes.  

To play, run the script, choose a difficulty level, and try to arrange the words correctly before time runs out.# project
